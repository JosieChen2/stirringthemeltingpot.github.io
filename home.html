            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout history, social change has always been a constant as marginalized groups experience various forms of social injustice and refuse to watch complicity as inequality continues. From the Revolutionary War to the abolition of slavery, to the Suffragist movement, the United States has seen many social changes in its short history as a country. However, some of the most monumental movements occurred within the 20th century, including those of the No-No Boys of the Japanese Internment Camps, the Black Panther Party created by African-Americans in the 1960’s, and the Feminist Movement of the same time. All of these movements worked to expose the hypocrisy Japanese Americans, African Americans, and women experienced in the United States that other groups did not. Following a long history of discrimination in the United States, Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were sent to prison camps in the midwest after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Many Japanese American men resisted this unlawful relocation through refusing to serve with absolute loyalty to the United States Armed Forces and multiple cases regarding were even presented to the</p></div>

Another monumental change occurred about two decades after WWII, when women across the U.S. began becoming more aware of their position in society. After working in the war industry and the armed forces during the 1940’s, women were expected to happily return to their lives as housewives. Achieving at the most, a degree in education in case they did not meet a man in college, women were often married before they graduated, and soon became mothers, pressured to be content with cooking and cleaning and expending their emotions on their children and husbands. However, in the 60’s, books like Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique, the creation of organizations like the National Organization for Women, and conversations started on city streets and college campuses lead to public demonstrations and some of the biggest changes in how our country sees gender. At the same time that the Feminist Movement was picking up steam, black Americans who were unsatisfied with the continued lack of equality and rights burdening their lives even after the Civil Rights Movement were fighting with their lives for equal rights across the U.S.,&nbsp;</p></div>

Although they fought for equality in underrepresented communities, they faced many different injustices, whether that be mistreatment from local police officers or national hate towards their campaign from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who launched a counterintelligence program to infiltrate and ultimately destroy the party. All three of these movements used the media, public demonstration, and legal action to change the minds of others and ultimately create social change. <strong>Thus, social change occurs when a marginalized group subject to unjust treatment exposes the hypocrisy of their society and government; in particular, the Feminist Movement, the Black Panther Party, and Japanese Americans used the power of media, public demonstrations, and legal action to change people’s minds about the flaws of their society.&nbsp;</strong></p></div>
