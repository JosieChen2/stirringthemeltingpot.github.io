            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feminist Movement created social change through the exploitation of the media, public demonstration and legal action to ultimately change the minds of people across the United States. After the huge increase in women in the workforce during WWII, men fighting overseas returned and re-claimed the jobs women had previously occupied, forcing them back into even more restrictive roles as housewives and mothers. In the 1950’s and early 60’s women were expected to go to college for the purpose of meeting a man to marry, and less importantly, earn a degree in education in case they could not find a husband and needed to sustain themselves for a short while before they did. Most women were married before they graduated, and soon became mothers and housewives, expected to be content with the newest laundry machine or refrigerator. While white women struggled to get jobs as secretaries or flight attendants, women of color were not even considered for the jobs, often left to work as maids. Around the beginning of 1963, Betty Friedan published her book titled The Feminine Mystique, detailing the isolation and sadness of the abysmal life of the American housewife. Thousands of women felt their struggle had finally been exposed and were now free to discuss the discontent they felt with their lives with their friends, connecting women nationally. Friedan also made appearances on television, capturing the attention of men, women, and young girls who would grow up to be the radical feminists leading the movement, who might not have read her book, further spreading her idea that it was normal for women to want to aspire to more than life as a housewife, educating the thousands of viewers watching the shows she appeared&nbsp;</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>on. However, despite the advancements Friedan and her book made in educating people about the lives and struggles of housewives, they did not include the experiences of women who were actually content with their lives, and did not initiate conversations about the struggles other women faced, such as racial inequality or domestic violence. Thus, although it did not completely capture the vast array of experiences women had during the 1950’s and 60’s, Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique is an excellent example of the way the Feminist Movement utilized the media in its efforts to create social change and reshape the minds of society on women’s roles. Another example of the way the Feminist Movement was able to create social change was through public demonstration. As the movement began to pick up steam, more and more women, especially younger women, were excited to organize and mobilize the movement to create a show of force. On August 26th, 1970, the 50th anniversary of the passing of the 19th Amendment which won women the right to vote, women in 40 cities across the country including 10,000 people in New York, marched for equality. The streets were filled with thousands of women, men, and children all standing in solidarity with women, creating quite a powerful and beautiful spectacle. Women carried signs reading “I love my husband, I love those nights, I also love my daily rights,” “Women strike for peace - and equality,” and “Women for racial and economic equality,” illustrating the vast array of issues that women face, from sexism in the home and workplace, to violent acts towards them, to racial and economic inequality. This public demonstration really brought to light the&nbsp;</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>immense mass of people determined to bring equality to women, and the unity and power of public demonstration. A final way the Feminist movement created social change was through taking legal action. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which barred discrimination based on a person’s sex, race, color, national origin, or religion, supposedly breaking down barriers for women in the workplace. However, despite the change the Act was supposed to make, women still faced discrimination in the workplace, and because of this, the National Organization for Women was created. Tackling the legislative aspect of the problem, the organization sued when they saw discrimination and took the cases to court to expose and challenge the system. One particularly momentous case was Weeks vs. Southern Bell, in which Lorena Weeks, mother to three children in Georgia, sued the Southern Bell Telephone Company which had restricted her advancement from telephone operator to switchman because she would have to lift 30-pound equipment each day. Lorena and her lawyer from NOW, Sylvia Roberts, argued that it was ridiculous to assume that women were unable to lift 30 pound equipment because they regularly lifted 30 pound children, and after losing multiple times, finally won $31,000, the job as the switch woman, and the first victory for NOW that used the Civil Rights Act to fight gender discrimination. The win signaled that women were willing to fight for their rights in all areas, whether that be in courts where the odds of losing were very high. Thus, the Feminist Movement created social change through exploiting the media, publicly demonstrating, and taking legal action.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
