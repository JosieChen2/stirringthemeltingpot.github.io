I know you think I’m going to start another one of my rambles about how the world is such a weird and broken and bruised place that has the potential to be great, but I promise- I have a point. I’m going to give you a history lesson, my good friend, because God knows you don’t pay attention in your history class at school.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It all started years before the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December of 1941. Even before the bomb was dropped by those Japanese planes, the Asian population in America was subject to harsh ridicule and racial prejudice by Americans who saw every Chinese and Japanese immigrant with disgust. To be honest though, it was just because they wanted to sell more fruit and couldn’t do that with so many Japanese immigrants around, but that’s just the beginning of the tale of hypocrisy that is American history. My great-grandparents knew it. Your great-grandparents knew it, too. The warhead was just the cherry-on-top.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After that, everything spiraled downward. Every Japanese and Japanese American- regardless of whether or not they were actually immigrants or if they had lived in America their entire lives- was considered a threat to national security and belittled to shame. Next thing you know, they were all shipped off to some far away internment camp to await the end of World War II. They called it “Executive Order 9066.” You would have been one of them had you been alive less than a century ago solely because of the very much Japanese blood running through your veins right now.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder what would have happened if they stopped to listen to the Japanese and Japanese Americans who pleaded for the government to see their innocence as they were plucked out of their homes and forced to leave everything they had behind. Maybe if they tried to look beyond their wartime hysteria, they would have seen how incredibly irrational they were to lock up an entire people on a mere suspicion and pent up xenophobia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That’s not even the end of it. After being relocated, the Nisei and Issei were given a choice: enlist or be branded a traitor. They called this one, “Selective Service Form 304A”- a.k.a the loyalty questionnaire. Questions 27 and 28 of the form were particularly controversial. They asked whether or not Japanese men would be willing to serve in the United States Army and basically forsake all allegiance to Japan. Can you imagine the audacity that the United States government must have had?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many enlisted, eager to prove their unfaltering loyalty to their country. They served, honorably so. Over 300 did not. They quite publicly refused to fight for a nation that so unjustly presumed their disloyalty and forced them into internment. They answered questions 27 and 28 with a loud and clear “no”.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, they were dubbed the “No-No Boys,” and boy did they start a ruckus. Not only were they heavily persecuted by the government for refusing to pledge their loyalty to America, but they were also put to shame by many other Nisei who believed that they needed to prove their allegiance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is, Aiko, despite all of the opposition from both sides of the battle, these No-No Boys stood their ground and carried out what they realized was the right kind of resistance to the injustice being thrown at them. To them, publicly declaring their refusal to succumb to the hypocrisy and arrogance of their discriminatory government was their way of making the issue in their society known. They needed to cause a stir, so they did.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For any young activist, this is the first step: learning the right time to resist the hypocrisy that is being forced upon you despite the harsh opposition you face for the sake of exposing it for all to see. The No-No Boys did it through demonstration, and, to say the least, it worked. They were able to spark a change in the mistreatment of Japanese Americans being incarcerated, and they definitely didn’t do it by saying “yes” to everyone and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But, like I just said- that’s only the first part.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The No-No Boys weren’t the only Japanese to take on the racist government head-on during World War II. Elsewhere, multiple Japanese living in America caused much more than a stir by taking their injustices to the courts. The three cases brought to light include those of Gordon Hirabayashi, Fred Korematsu, and Mitsuye Endo.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both Gordon Hirabayashi, a student at UDub, and Fred Korematsu, an Oakland native, were  arrested and charged with the crime of failing to register for their “voluntary” relocation. Mitsuye Endo, also from California, was interned but petitioned the War Relocation Authority for his release. All three took their cases to the Supreme Court- not a petty thing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Supreme Court ruled against the former two defendants, but in the case of Endo, the Court officially ruled in his favor. Thus, as of January, 1945, all Japanese American citizens native to the United States were freed from their internment camps under the ruling that they could not lawfully be detained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hirabayashi, Korematsu, and Endo did what many others facing the same injustice could not: they confronted those in charge and were responsible for the hypocrisy of their racist government. They took it all the way to the Supreme Court, which judging solely by its name, one can tell isn’t something that can easily be ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is exactly what you need to do. If you want something to happen- for example, if you want all unlawfully relocated Japanese Americans to be given their rightful freedom- you need to do something about it. Start with resisting- publicly. Say no. Protest. Make the hypocrisy of our society and government known. <em>Show</em> them the wrong they are imposing upon an oppressed people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want evoke true social change- the kind that benefits numbers of people and will have lasting positive effects- you need to do it in a way that is irrefutable. Start with publicly demonstrating but continue with taking the necessary legal action that will set in stone the change you want to see in the world around you. Find the people with power in the legal system and knock on their doors, talk in their ears, send them emails, write them letters, petition for laws to the point of which they are so annoyed with your relentlessness that they give you what you want. Scream it at the top of your lungs. <em>Make</em> people listen to you.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">That is the power of an activist who is capable of generating genuine social change- the power of someone who is willing to make a public demonstration and take it to a legal level.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know Berkeley High has no shortage of young activists such as yourself- I mean, come on, it’s Berkeley. You’re not living in World War II, nor is your entire family being relocated to some internment camp. But, you have your own battles to fight, whether it be for gender equality, environmental sustainability- it doesn’t matter. Whatever the reason for change, just remember that it only comes when you are willing to publicly expose the hypocrisy of your society and government and challenge the very laws that govern it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The No-No Boys, Hirabayashi, Korematsu, and Endo were all able to do it. So can you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>Josie</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
